# Terminus

Terminus is a Drush-based CLI interface into the Pantheon core API via a
pseudoproxy.

Terminus is being developed initially to support some engineering and partner
edge cases (DevOps shops, Kalabox, proviso), but we hope to make it a solid tool
for all command-line and script-savvy developers.

If you'd like to write your own code using Terminus as an example, other PHP
libraries can be used to make direct API calls.

See `drush help --filter=terminus` for a list of commands, and visit the
[Pantheon Helpdesk Article on Terminus](http://helpdesk.getpantheon.com/customer/portal/articles/1315417)
for detailed help.

## Requirements

* Drush 5.8 or higher - https://github.com/drush-ops/drush
* PHP 5.3.3 or higher with cURL

## Installation

Terminus should be installed and updated using git and Composer.

[Composer](http://getcomposer.org) is a dependency manager for PHP, and Terminus
can be found in the main Composer repository [Packagist](https://packagist.org/)
as [pantheon-systems/terminus](https://packagist.org/packages/pantheon-systems/terminus)

The easiest way to install Composer for *nix (including Mac):

    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

More detailed installation instructions for multiple platforms can be found in
the [Composer Documentation](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).

### Normal installation

    # Download Terminus.
    git clone https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus.git $HOME/.drush/terminus
    # Download dependencies.
    cd $HOME/.drush/terminus
    composer update --no-dev
    # Clear Drush's cache.
    drush cc drush

That's it! If you ever need to update Terminus, just use the following commands:

    # Update Terminus.
    cd $HOME/.drush/terminus
    git pull
    # Update Terminus dependencies.
    composer update --no-dev
    # Clear Drush's cache.
    drush cc drush

### Development installation

If you want to contribute to Terminus development, you'll want to download the
dependencies for performing Unit Tests as well.

    # Make a projects directory if it doesn't already exist.
    mkdir -p $HOME/Projects
    # Download Terminus and development dependencies.
    git clone https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus.git $HOME/Projects/terminus
    # Download dependencies.
    composer update --working-dir $HOME/Projects/terminus
    # Symbolically link Terminus directory to make it available to drush
    ln -s $HOME/Projects/terminus $HOME/.drush/terminus
    # Clear Drush's cache.
    drush cc drush

Terminus includes a number of Unit Tests for automated quality assurance. If you
add or modify functionality, please include test coverage as well.

    # Change directory.
    cd $HOME/Projects/terminus
    # Execute unit tests
    run_tests.sh

Updates can be performed in the directory:

    # Update Terminus.
    git pull
    # Update Terminus dependencies.
    composer update
    # Clear Drush's cache.
    drush cc drush

## Quick Demo

    # Authenticate.
    drush pantheon-auth
    # List all your sites.
    drush pantheon-sites
    # Download and replace pantheon.aliases.drushrc.php
    drush pantheon-aliases
    # Show all Terminus commands.
    drush help --filter=terminus

## Build a site on Pantheon with drush_make

    # Specify the site name...
    SITE_NAME=REPLACEME
    # And a description...
    SITE_DESC="Building a site with drush_make and Terminus"
    # Authenticate.
    drush pauth YOUR@EMAIL.COM --password=TOOMANYSECRETS
    # Create the site using Drupal 7 (drops-7) as the base.
    drush psite-create $SITE_NAME --label="$SITE_DESC" --product=21e1fada-199c-492b-97bd-0b36b53a9da0
    # Update your aliases.
    drush paliases
    # Determine the site_uuid of the newly created site and save as variable SITE_UUID.
    SITE_UUID=`drush psite-uuid $SITE_NAME | cut -f2 -d' '`
    # Change the connection mode of the dev environment to SFTP.
    drush psite-cmode $SITE_UUID dev sftp
    # Use a public URL as the source for drush_make to download a few modules.
    drush -y @pantheon.$SITE_NAME.dev make --no-core https://raw.github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus/master/demo.make
    # Install the site. Remember to grab the password, or use drush uli later.
    drush -y @pantheon.$SITE_NAME.dev si --site-name="$SITE_DESC" pantheon
    # Commit the changes.
    drush psite-commit $SITE_UUID dev --message="Base tools from drush_make"
    # Change the connection mode back to git.
    drush psite-cmode $SITE_UUID dev git
    # Disable unnecessary modules.
    drush -y @pantheon.$SITE_NAME.dev dis overlay comment rdf toolbar
    # Enable new modules.
    drush -y @pantheon.$SITE_NAME.dev en admin_menu module_filter features views views_ui ctools generate_errors admin_menu_toolbar devel_generate
    # Generate test content.
    drush @pantheon.$SITE_NAME.dev generate-content 50
    # Deploy code to test environment.
    drush psite-deploy $SITE_UUID test
    # Deploy content to test environment.
    drush psite-clone $SITE_UUID dev test

## TODO

- Human readable and exportable Connection Information for site environments
- Log access
- HTTP library to remove cURL requirement
- Upload archive to Pantheon for site imports
- Better Unit Test coverage
- In-progress job status
- Websockets support for real-time status info?
- A "pantheon shell" option to keep you in context for interactive use
